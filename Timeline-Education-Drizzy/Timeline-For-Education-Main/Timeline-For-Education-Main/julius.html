        <h1>Julius Plucker's Experiment</h1>
    </header>
    <div class="content">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Julius Plucker, a German physicist, tries an experiment in which he embeds metal plates into either end of an evacuated glass tube and then places a high voltage across the plates. (Plucker thought that maybe electricity was a fluid of some kind, and the general idea of his experiment was to see if he could force the "electric fluid" to squirt out where he could see it.) Well, he doesn't see any electric fluid, but he does notice that the tube glows an eerie green, and that the pattern of the green light can be shifted with a magnet.</p>

        <p>Tech Note - All Plucker was doing was sending electrons through the space between the two metal plates. An electric current is just electrons, and if you send a current across a vacuum, then the electrons become freely moving particles. The green light Plucker saw was free electrons whacking into the atoms in the glass and exciting their spectral lines (like the lines shown above), some of which happened to be green. Spectral lines are created whenever the bound electrons in an atom are jumping from one energy level to another, and this jumping can be caused by heat, by particle impact, by incoming electromagnetic radiation, etc. The pattern could be shifted with a magnet because moving electrons (like all moving charged objects) are affected by magnetic fields.</p>
